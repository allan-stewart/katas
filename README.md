# Katas
A set of code kata descriptions (not implementations).

## Code Katas
Code katas are problems (usually small) used to practice programming skills and techniques.
You may try the same kata multiple times with different implementations or to see how quickly you can solve it.
Try practicing your keyboard shortcuts, or experiment with techniques like test driven development or dependency injection.

## Architectural Katas
Similar to code katas, are a form of practice.
But instead of writing code, a small group of people design a solution to a problem and then share and critique each other's work.
You can learn more about them (and find more katas) at [Neal Ford's website](http://nealford.com/katas/).
